				<img src="images/canvas.png" alt="Lorem Pixel image">
				<p>In DSGN 1 course, my team and I found out there are some mistakes happended in the Canvas App, which cause confusing for student to use it. Hence, we interviewed a selective sample of UCSD students to understand their experience with Canvas App using a master-apprentice model </p>
				<p>Then, we utilized graphs to demonstrate the dataset and analyze the design space</p>
				<p>The picture below is how we redesign the Canvas App on IPhone</p>

				<img src="images/waterbottle.png" alt="Lorem Pixel image">
				<p>In DSGN 1 project, my team and I found out the trend and figured out the problem that UCSD students have in using the water bottle.</p>
				<p>We designed interview questions and interviewed selective UCSD students. Then, we ultilized graphs to demonstrate the dataset and analyze the design space, trade off and the patterns.</p>
				<p>For example, the graph belows that there were 8 over 10 participants that used the stainless steel water bottle because it affords versatility as users can put drinks with any temperatures in it without worrying about damaging the product</p>
